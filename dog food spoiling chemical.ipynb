    "### Identify the preservatives in dog food that causes early spoilage and prediction of spoilage or not\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been identified by a dog food company that some batches of the foods are spoiling much quicker than intended! Unfortunately this Dog Food company hasn't upgraded to the latest machinery, meaning that the amounts of the five preservative chemicals they are using can vary a lot, but which is the chemical that has the strongest effect? The dog food company first mixes up a batch of preservative that contains 4 different preservative chemicals (A,B,C,D) and then is completed with a \"filler\" chemical. The food scientists beelive one of the A,B,C, or D preservatives is causing the problem, but need your help to figure out which one. We will  use Machine Learning witt ensembles(trees) to find out which parameter had the most predicitive power, thus finding out which chemical causes the early spoiling.\n",
