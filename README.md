## Installation
The libraries employed in this project to run the code are Python 3.6,spark, java 1.8. It is  recommended 
that you use java 1.8 because java 11 is not compatible with other required libraries.

## Project Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to learn how to use spark for big data analysis since 
the rate real data are generated are so huge that our traditional system can not store and process
this data on the run. Spark makes it easier to work with big data by also providing platform to build, 
deploy and automate our machine learning algorithms at higher efficiency. In this work, we will build machine learning 
models using the MLlib to detect the actual preservative chemical in dog food responsible for early spoilage in a dog producing company.
## File Descriptions
The files associated with this work include
* The jupyter ipython notebook 
* The data - dog_food.csv file 
* The permission - license.txt file 
## Results
â€¢	Identified chemical C with above 98% feature importance to be causing early dog food spoilage
